Completed Projects. PROJECTS in DEVELOPMENT

WOLVERINE HUG  is a MESSAGE, test
to get own Projects more discoverable
and push limits.
Main Forum Thread of WOLVERINE HUG

"WolverineHUG" (phrase meaning) - noone cares, noone will see what You do, noone will support You,
You won't acomplishe anything, and nothing left here for You...
only warm, sharp, friendly, Deadly Wolverine Hugs a waits You.

in 13 DAYS without food almost to no sleep by one person performing such test 
(with poor hardware)

Completed: 
---Idea, Drawing sketch, Vector image,  
----Story, Short Animation video, Melody (2DAYS with nights)
-----4 page Comics, 2D, 3D Game prototypes (10DAYS mostly with nights)
All using only free software.

(Completing  of more usable versions of games takes more time
do to luck of knowledge, expirience, poor hardware.)

It's a stubborn, strugle project to make, spread and transfer message in different forms
without any distuctions, no sleep, no eat, no dancing...
---Idea born from reaching end of resources and supply to support self maintance,
undefiable willing - want to continue work no mattare what happens.
and still Complete own chosen tasks.
CHECK INFO on HOW IT WAS DONE.

With HIGH hopes and minimal expactaions 
that it will lead, to improvement of projects promotion, distribution,
reach interested audience, for further collaboration and wider production.
Stabilizing life staite, and finding resources, funds for self and projects managment.

Chosen forms of MESSAGE to fullfil project and make it complete and variative:
Idea, Drawing, Story, Melody, Animation, Comics, Games.
(...some of forms more or less familiar to X-POWER but highly interested in all, 
so up to challange.)

X-P hardworker & selftaught

designer, story-script writer,
vfxartist(not pro), music creator, animator,
programmer(low skilled), illustrator-sketcher,

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Posts and Project MEASSAGE haven't found any interest
Failed in promotion and destribution. 
funding, employment, discoverability - but Completed.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

will patch up game versions 
complete in few more forms(mostly game versions FPS, Novel, Platformer)
repost and releas materials of project opensource for free use 
on GitHub and other platforms.


...continue to work on main projects
and searching for ways to support them and find audience.



HOW WORK was DONE 
process of project creation

TWO days with nights
  to COMPLETE
 this from scratch


!!!ENORMOUSLY GRATEFUL to ALL DEVS!!!
and USERS who ask and share tips


Software - 

OS -
WinXP,  WinX

Hardware -
Lenovo ideapad s10-2 
(x86 only, no OpenGL, can't FullHD, 
dead line of pixels, program window can't fit screen size,
 cooling problems, 
!!BUT handeld to WORK 
in such cruel use scenarios,
 
awfull perfomence for such tasks, 
!!!BUT been able to push through)
                           
  

TWO days with nights
  to COMPLETE
Video from scratch

Haven't slept, haven't ate and lose focus for all the time
ACTUALY:
haven't ate anything      - all these days, 
drank water while renders - 3 times, 
slept ones while render   - from 6am till 10am at first day.
Versions of project files - 81+ >.
Failed renders            - 30+ > (estimated).
Wonder off out of work    - none times.
--Had to check render files while rendering proces, render parts, 
were bugs and unexpected results, had to check every frame of render process 
to save time and stop bad renders)


KMPlayer 3.0.0.1439 
(other players can't render FullHD at all on his machine, KMP sound out of sync and video 2 times slower)
Virtualdub(synced sound but lags video and sound) 
Avidemux 2.7.4.5 (lugs but close to KMP result while able to preview even 4k.)

Netbook couldn't render boxblur - had to settle for low pass, qmlt just died on render start.
Wich lead to searching what breaks project render.
 
Render problems, Preview too slow couldn't figure out Actual spead of effects, 
Faild to render full, had to render to img sequence,
then render by parts, then by layers with, without effects,
then full together but by parts. And final render.

Last Complete render finished on 7:37 of third day, cleaning work till 8:30 
going to sleep now.

-WAKE UP 10:30
work on post
 
WANT TO WORK AND COMPLETE MORE PROJECTS!!!
 
-----------------------------------------------------
Slept 6-10 hours after video.  and To next Part of PROJECT.
                

THREE days with nights
  to COMPLETE
Comics, 2D Game
(concept, prototype)

Slept 6-10 hours after video. 
Then Haven't slept again.
Still haven't ate anything.

Started work on 4 page Comics and expressed in it some laughter and project sense. 
Write idea of every page in txt 
then With Help of Gimp and prerendered video screens from Shotcut, 
and use of Inkscape vector images made earlier, exports of parts in png.
Complete Panels.
---Few times lights went off and dead battery showed it's pleasence.
(Lost and recovered one page)
OUT of space o ssd and Memory, buged, laged, and failed all few dozen times.


Started from to writing concept for 2d game.
First happened write Novel,
but to much details to complete and prototype in few days.(for later)
Next arkanoid with  gameplay connected to project MESSAGE sense. 

Concept:

Blocks of Bad words like
"CAN'T" "YOU LOSE" and etc. 
Spawns and Push Character down Till he is pressed to wall(spikes) start lose health till Die.

Player should avoid or destroy them.
Destroying them regain health and gives score.  

Wolverine wanders, pushes words on player, scale them and regenerate their health. And if collide with player will hug to death or harm.


Main Goal of Game to survive as long as You can and Gain Highest score.

Counts Time, Destroyd words, collisions with Wolverine.

Completed art in Gimp. Started research of tutorials that suit idea. Then work in HaxeFlixel, Till got most of process codes prototyped. 

Made post of alpha on Itchio
-Game needs more work now it's mostly a skeleton and statement of it's eexistance with ability to test out.

-wich SUITS main purpoes



...Fall a sleep 4 hours, drank some water and Continued to 3D version...

EIGHT days mostly with nights
  to COMPLETE
 3D Unity game prototype

Slept some times for few hours in the morning, three days didn't slept straight, still haven't ate anyhing.

Started with writing down 3D game concept for Unity version.

Player control Wolverine 
Who want to HUG all the sad creatores(HUGtargets). 

You have to Hug as much as You can till time ends.
(write down a lot of additional FETURES,  to make IF PROJECT gain interest)

From the start decided to use/mod amazing "Standard Asset Example Projects" to make fast prototype.
Downloaded instaled.
Made copy Rename Project to Wolverine HUG and start deleting not needed.

Searched for 3D modeling tutorial for Blender. I used Blender but actualy haven't made own fully rigged model ttill this Time.

3D version of HUGtarget 
was complet in 4hours+ 
hardware was not willing to work fast and luck of expirience.

For 3D Wolverine 
decided to have another aproach, wanted more close to drawing
needed to creat fast and don't lose 2D drawing details. 

Tryed converting vector sketch and modeling from that.
Had problems and mistakes -
Completed in 18 hours

(hardware slow and few times crashed project, aditionaly not active process of modeling and fixing bugs made head switch off all the time for few minutes)

HAving not fully 3D more cartoonish Wolverine(effect that was desireable) NEEDed time to figureout way to creat,  2D to 3D with still Look like 2D

EXAMPLE: Mouth and eyes not to be spheres, be flat but with depth.
And outline wich, Diched in the end.

Import in to Unity
Used great tool Rigify for Blender
and saw how it's usefull
Tryed, but it was not what I wanted 
at this situation, Lost almost Day
Finaly digged Out on My forum
Post of my last Modding expirience
In Blender and the way to Add
Unrigged model to rigged and replace it
Exported Eathan from Unity Standard Assets
and imported in Blender with errors
Helped answer on Unity forum
Reimported Flawlesly
Replaced Ethan with Wolverine
and replaced Ethan with Hug Target.
Imported in Unity and had first test run.
Edited skeleton for Wolverine many times.
Editing of camera to Look write.
Deletated map and created own box.
Realy liked look of rose boxes so Added them to story. They blend Nicely.
And planed in future be the way points and spawn points and places for HUGtargets to wine nicely.
Edited slightly form to look better.
Worked on Materials and posteffects to see finaly desireable image.
Atmosphere, wanted darkness and harder to see HUGtargets(in future they should disapere for YOU to search for them)
Worked on additionat top Camera without satisfyied effect.
Made HUG animation in blender. Made sit and run out Animation in Blender 
Worked on cuting fat of idea to complete some main gameplay parts.
Having a lmost none knowladge with Unity and working on old version,
all the time poped out problems and methods of solving them wasn't easy to find
Example scen loading changed in unity 5.3. All tutorials on scen loading was usless. 
Lost half a day.
Tryed to figureout and find easy wandering script for HUGtargets.
Problems with adding animation on button press.
Munu and UI had the most fun, almost 1,5 days woked to make menu UI button work, and in the END
Project just couldn't work right and it's why nothing worked. Had to make Menu in different
Project. Remake first project and import completed menu.
Finaly Made draft of Game You Have Start End And You can ran Around  been Wolverine
and Bash into bubled coliding HUGtargets.
Started building And It was a FAILL.
